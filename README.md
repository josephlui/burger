Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Once the burger has been added, the user can choose to devour it.  The devoured burgers are displayed on the right hand side of the page.  The app leverages JAWSDB Mysql to store all the burger entries deployed on Heroku.
